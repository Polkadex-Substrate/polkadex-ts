## Polkadex UI Github practices

### Branches

When working on a new feature or fixing a bug, create a new branch from the **develop branch**. This allows you to keep the main branch stable while you work on the new changes.

- **main** The main branch is the primary branch in a Git repository and serves as the "live" or "production" version of the code. Changes made to this branch should be thoroughly tested and reviewed before being merged. The main branch should always reflect a stable and working version of the code.
- **develop** The develop branch is a secondary branch in a Git repository and serves as the integration branch for new features and bug fixes. This branch is used for ongoing development and is where pull requests are typically made to before they are merged into the main branch. The develop branch allows for a separation of the main branch and the testing of new changes before they are integrated into the production version of the code.
  - Rules: Max 10 PR to create a develop PR for Main.

  - **feature/package-name/feature-name** The feature/feature-name branch is a temporary non blocking branch used for **preparing and testing a small features release in a single package**. This branch is created **from the develop branch**.
      - Rules: - Changes in only 1 package.
      - Branch naming: feature/package-name/feature-name
      - Usecase example: Filter transactions in @polkadex-ui/the-frontend        
      
  - **release/package-name/release-name** The release/feature-name branch is a temporary branch used for **preparing and testing major features**. This branch is **created from the develop branch**.
      - Rules: Changes in only 1 package.
      - Branch naming: release/package-name/feature-name
      - Usecase example: BalancesProvider in @polkadex-ui/thea-balancesprovider.

- **Write clear and concise commit messages**: Commit messages should explain the purpose of each change in a concise and understandable way. This helps other contributors and maintainers understand the history of the project and make it easier to revert changes if necessary. A good commit message follows the pattern: "Subject: Short description of changes - Body: Additional details (optional)".
    
  Additionally worth to mention **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** specification, which helps not only with readability, but could also be used to write automated tools on top of it.

## Rules

- **Include screencasts with showing implemented features**: When creating screencasts to demonstrate implemented features, it is important to include visual demonstrations of the features in action. This can help to understand how the features work and how they can be used effectively.

- **Donâ€™t do force pushes**: This is a bad practice which leads to inconsistent history and can lead to losing some parts of code and issues for your teammates. Info about why this is bad is easy to find. 

- **Configure protected branches**: Should be properly configured protected branches like main, develop, release etc. which should by default restrict force pushes, direct pushes without review and CI checks and much more.   

- **Make pull requests for code review**: Pull requests allow other contributors to review and comment on your changes before they are merged into the main branch. This helps catch potential issues or suggest improvements before they become a problem. Pull requests also provide a way for other contributors to give you feedback and suggest changes.

- **Document your code**: Adequate documentation is essential for others to understand and use your code. You should include comments in your code to explain what each section does and why it's necessary.

- **Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking and project management**: GitHub Issues is a built-in tool for tracking bugs and managing the project. You can create and assign issues to specific contributors, add labels and milestones, and track the progress of your project.
  - Example: One example of a well-run project on GitHub is the React library, developed by Facebook. They use clear and concise commit messages, create branches for new features, use pull requests for code review, provide detailed documentation, and use GitHub Issues to track bugs and manage the project.


## Developing
When you are ready to start developing you can clone the repo and start.

1. Fork the repo first, then clone it locally.
```
gh repo clone Polkadex-Substrate/Polkadex-UI
yarn 
```

2. You can then run all packages and test Thea Frontend by browsing to http://localhost:3000 with:
```
yarn dev
```

Or run packages manually with:
```
yarn workspace @polkadex-ui/components dev
yarn workspace @polkadex-ui/nativechainprovider dev
yarn workspace @polkadex-ui/thea-frontend dev
...
```
